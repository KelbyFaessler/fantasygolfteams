# Compute algorithm ported from C++ to python
###############################################################################

# Algorithm design in python:
#   Allow for function to be called from other python code (passing player list)
#       or as a standalone script (reads player list from file like c++ code)
#   Create class for player (name, cost, birdie avg)
#   Is it possible to have an algorithm that is more efficient than O(n^4)? It 
#       doesn't seem possible because we need to look at all team combinations.
#       unless there is some clever way to somehow only look at the best teams
#       and ignore other combos of players? Maybe this would work if we sorted
#       the player list by birdie avg and iterate from the top down, checking 
#       if a team is less than total cost allowance and if it's a better team
#       than the current 10 best. If it's not, then we can immidiately move to
#       a new combo of players since we know its only going to get worse
#   Is this a version of the knapsack problem without repeats?
#       Is that the 0/1 knapsack problem?
#       Use the 'meet in the middle' algorithm since I have non-integer weights
#       (costs)
#   Search for knapsack problem dynamic programming
#   Might be interesting to run a c++ solution not using dynamic programming 
#       and compare runtimes to the dynamic programming solution
